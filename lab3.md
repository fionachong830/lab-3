1. This paper is about cyber physical commerce logistics system. This can improve the process of decision making and getting informations  by having sensing technologies, industrial wearable technologies. Also, drone can be used to collect real-time data. Besides, the pallets, forklifts, pickers and packers will get an autopus or a sensor to get information.  Isync can be used to get and upload data to an app or an excel files which can help with scheduling and let customers know the states of their items. Lastly, there will be a dashboard to let the managers know the real-time data and states of the robots, and the tasks. Therefore, they can monitor the progress easily.
